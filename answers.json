            "answer": "D flip flop is an electronic devices that is known as \u201cdelay flip flop\u201d or \u201cdata flip flop\u201d which is used to store single bit of data.D flip flops are synchronous or asynchronous. The clock single required for the synchronous version of D flip flops but not for the asynchronous one.The D flip flop has two inputs, data  and clock input which controls the flip flop. when clock input is high, the data is transferred to the output of the flip flop and when the clock input is low, the output of the flip flop is held in its previous state.",

            "answer": "Shift Register is a group of flip flops used to store multiple bits of data. The bits stored in such registers can be made to move within the registers and in/out of the registers by applying clock pulses. An n-bit shift register can be formed by connecting n flip-flops where each flip-flop stores a single bit of data. The registers which will shift the bits to the left are called \u201cShift left registers\u201d. The registers which will shift the bits to the right are called \u201cShift right registers\u201d. Shift registers are basically of following types.",
